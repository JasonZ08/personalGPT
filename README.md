# PersonalGPT

PersonalGPT is a personalized chat bot where you can feed in personal information and 
have the chat bot query it. You can store the data in either a text file or in a SQLITE
Database and the chat bot will retrieve the information from either location. The 
chat bot has a neural network built inside that determines from the question whether
to query the text file or the database. Using keywords like "text file" and "database" 
helps the chat bot figure out where to search.
